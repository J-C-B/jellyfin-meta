# Jellyfin Social Contract

Draft 1 of Version 1.0, 2021-02

Based heavily on the [Debian Social Contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract).

## "Social Contract" with the Jellyfin Community

1. Jellyfin will remain 100% free.

Jellyfin is and will remain 100% free software. This includes both software freedom as defined by the Free Software Foundation in [The Free Software Definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en), as well as cost. The Jellyfin project will not charge any amount of money for the software it provides.

*In human terms*: We are both free as in speech, and free as in beer, forever.

2. Jellyfin will remain funded entirely by donations.

Jellyfin funds itself exclusively from donations by individual users. It does not and will not accept any sponsorship or other monetary compensation in exchange for features, priority access, support, or any other work by the community.

*In human terms*: We will not sell out our project for money.

3. Jellyfin is a community, volunteer effort.

Jellyfin is built entirely and exclusively by volunteer contributors who donate their free time to the project. Jellyfin will not hire or pay for development or design effort for the project.

*In human terms*: We are all volunteers and will always remain so.

4. Jellyfin will give back to the free software community 

Jellyfin builds upon other free software components such as FFmpeg, and will contribute back to that community as much as possible.

*In human terms*: If we modify something from an upstream, we will always offer it back.

5. Jellyfin will not hide problems

Jellyfin will keep its bug reporting open for public view at all times, via GitHub issues. The sole exception is to facilitate private disclosure of serious security vulnerabilities which may affect public installations of Jellyfin, which should be made directly to the Core team via email or Matrix chat to coordinate disclosure in as short a time-frame as possible. We welcome fixes to bugs from anyone as a good first contribution.

*In human terms*: We will not hide bugs from the public, but keep them open and encourage fixes.

6. Jellyfin's priorities are our contributors, users and free software

Jellyfin's priority is to our users, which includes most of our contributors as well - we contribute because we use. We will seek to always support our users to the best of our capabilities. We will prioritize free software in all decisions and ensure that users have the same rights. If the needs of our contributors and our users conflict, we will seek consensus and an amicable solution wherever possible.

*In human terms*: Our users are our most important asset, and we seek to ensure their experience with Jellyfin is the best it can be.

7. Jellyfin's contributors will treat each other and our users with respect

All participants in the Jellyfin project must abide by our [community standards](community-standards.md) at all times, and maintain a respectful atmosphere for all. Disagreements are inevitable, and we encourage them to be settled by discussion, consensus-building, and democratic decision-making.

*In human terms*: Remember the human at all times, we are all people too.

8. Jellyfin's leadership team will guide the project towards these goals

As outlined in the [Jellyfin Constitution](jellyfin-constitution.md), the leadership team provides direction and guidance for the project towards the end of building a great, free software media system. This includes enforcing this social contract and providing recourse for the breaking of any of its terms. These documents keep us accountable both to other contributors, and to our users.

*In human terms*: The leadership team keeps everyone accountable, and everyone keeps the leadership team accountable.
