# New team member nomination process

Jellyfin's contributor team is a dynamic, ever growing set of contributors who assist in the running of the project. Since Jellyfin is a "do-ocracy", team members make up the backbone of the project, doing numerous jobs such as writing code, reviewing suggestions, moderating the community, and helping to troubleshoot and test.

This document outlines the steps that should be taken to nominate and accept a new member into the team.

## Process

1. Anyone who is currently on the Jellyfin team (defined as a member of #jellyfin-support-team and/or the GitHub organization) may nominate a community member for inclusion in the team.

1. Nominations should reflect the following 4 goals:

  a) Nominees should demonstrate a consistent, high-quality contribution to the project, e.g. in supporting users, contributing good code, or making & improving clients.
  b) Nominees should demonstrate respect for our values, a commitment to FLOSS development and a desire to see Jellyfin succeed.
  c) Nominees should be in good standing with the team and community and respect for the rules and community guidelines of the project.
  d) Nominees should be willing to contribute to the more mundane tasks (e.g. PR reviews) if they have not already demonstrated a desire to do so - with power comes responsibility.

1. Once a contributor has selected a nominee, the issue should be put to a discussion in #jellyfin-support-team. At least one Core team member should approve the decision, though this may be waived with overwhelming team support (barring blatant violations of the conditions of #2). Please include details of why this nominee and what you think they bring to the team.

1. Upon confirmation of a nomination, the team member who nominated them, or an admin team member, should reach out privately to the nominee to discuss with them. This should be framed as a question ("would you like to join the team?") rather than a demand, and should the nominee refuse the issue should be dropped.

1. If the nominee accepts, they should be immediately invited into the private team rooms (#jellyfin-support-team and #jellyfin-team-lounge) and a request for the Core team to add them to GitHub should then be arranged.

1. Upon acceptance of the nomination, please obtain, or ask the nominee to provide, (a) their GitHub username, (b) their Reddit username [if applicable, for flair], and (c) their desired Team on GitHub. Having this information in advance avoids back-and-forth when setting up access.

1. The nominee is now a member of the team and should be welcomed.
